A video super-resolution technique is expected to gen-erate a ‘sharp’ upsampled video.  The sharpness in thegenerated video comes from the precise prediction of thehigh-frequency details (e.g. object edges).  Thus high-frequency prediction becomes a vital sub-problem of thesuper-resolution task.  To generate a sharp-upsampledvideo, this paper proposes an upsampling network archi-tecture ‘HFR-Net’ that works on the principle of ‘explicitrefinement and fusion of high-frequency details’. To imple-ment this principle and to train HFR-Net, a novel techniquenamed 2-phase progressive-retrogressive training is beingproposed. Additionally, a method called dual motion warp-ing is also being introduced to preprocess the videos thathave varying motion intensities (slow and fast). Results onmultiple video datasets demonstrate the improved perfor-mance of our approach over the current state-of-the-art.
