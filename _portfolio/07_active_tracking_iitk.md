### Network Architecture
![Network](/images/rsnn_target_tracking.png)

* Improved upon an existing Siamese neural network based object tracker by designing a LSTM based memory network
* This auxiliary system learnt a motion model of the tracked objects and improved tracking accuracy in cases of occlusion
* The project report can be downloaded from <a href="/files/active_tracking.pdf">here</a>.
