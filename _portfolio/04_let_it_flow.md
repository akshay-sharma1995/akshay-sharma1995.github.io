Advisor: Prof. Amir Barati Farimani, Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University
* Designed architectures for GAN and VAE based optical flow estimators with an image pair conditioned generator.
* Compiled a comparative study of the above methods with the commonly used auto-encoder based optical flow estimators
