Advisor: Prof. Katia Sycara, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University
* Designed a neural network based observer policy capable of identifying states for which an RL agent is confused and facilitate efficient communication with an expert
* Resulting network cuts down on episode lengths and improves episode return while minimizing expert queries
