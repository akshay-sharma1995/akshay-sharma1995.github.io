### Network Architecture
![Network Acrhitecture](/images/vsr_network.png){:height="20%" width="100%"}
* Designed a novel 2-phase progressive-retrogressive training, and a dual motion warping frame alignment techiniques
* Designed a neural network for explicit refinement and fusion of high-frequency details of super resolved videos
* The system produced more visually appealing results than most SOTA methods with no noticeable temporal artifacts

### Results
