Advisor: Prof. Anurag Mittal, Computer Vision Lab, IIT Madras, India
* Designed a novel 2-phase progressive-retrogressive training, and a dual motion warping frame alignment techiniques
* Designed a neural network for explicit refinement and fusion of high-frequency details of super resolved videos
* The system produced more visually appealing results than most SOTA methods with no noticeable temporal artifacts
