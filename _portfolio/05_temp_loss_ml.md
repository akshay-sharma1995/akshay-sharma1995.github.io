Advisor: Prof. Amir Barati Farimani, Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University
* Designed an unsupervised version of the Flownet-C architecture for optical flow estimation
* Formulated a temporal smoothing loss term which penalizes large changes in consecutive optical flow maps
* Generated temporally smoother optical flow maps producing more temporally consistent warped images.
