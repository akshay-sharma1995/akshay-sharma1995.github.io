## About Me
Hey,
\
I am Akshay, I recently graduated from the Masters in Mechanical Engineering (Specialization in Robotics and Control) program at Carnegie Mellon University. I was a Graduate Assistant at the Advanced Agent Robotics Technology Lab, and was advised by Prof. Katia Sycara. My masters research focused on learning the behavior and mistake prediction of an RL agent. Apart from this I have worked extensively in Computer Vision specially in the area of Unsupervised Optical Flow estimation, and Video Super Resolution.
\
Before that I did my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kanpur, India.
\
I am very passionate about working in machine learning, computer vision, and reinforcement learning, and want to use my experience and skills in these fields to work on some real world projects which can be used in the near future.

## Current work
I am working as a Research Extern at the Advanced Agent Robotics Technology Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. There I am working on developing a Visual Dialog Based Search and Rescue Agent.
