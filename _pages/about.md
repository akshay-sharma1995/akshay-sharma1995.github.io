## About Me
I recently graduated from the Masters in Mechanical Engineering (Research) program at Carnegie Mellon University.I was a Graduate Assistant at the Advanced Agent Robotics Technology Lab, and was advised by Prof. Katia Sycara. Throughout my Masters I have done research in quite a few areas related to machine learning and deep learning. My research areas span from Computer Vision, Generative Networks, to Reinforcement Learning and Behavior Prediction. Before coming to CMU, I did my undergraduate studies at IIT Kanpur, India.
